A simple assembler for use with Notch's dcpu.

A description of the dcpu can be found at: http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt.

COMMENTS:
	- Not sure if strings are in the spec or not. Notch's earlier examples showed the use of strings, as well as a "DAT" tag. Both have been removed from my implementation.

SYNTAX:
	- Here's the simplified BNF the parser uses.

	stmt ::= <op> | : <name> <op>

	op ::= <b_op> <oper> , <oper> | <nb_op> <oper>

	b_op ::= SET | ADD | SUB | MUL | DIV | MOD | SHL | SHR | AND | BOR | XOR | IFE | IFN | IFG | IFB

	nb_op ::= JSR

	reg ::= A | B | C | X | Y | Z | I | J | PC | SP | O

	st_op ::= PUSH | POP | PEEK

	oper ::= [ <expr> ] | <term>

	expr ::= <numeric> + <reg> | <hex_numeric> + <reg> | <numeric> | <hex_numeric> | <reg>

	term ::= <name> | <numeric> | <hex_numeric> | <reg> | <st_op>
